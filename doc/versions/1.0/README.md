# JAAL 1.0

"JAAL 1.0" refers to the initial JAAL version in Giacomo Mariani's
master's thesis. It has no specification; the reference implementation is
the only specification.

[A demo of JAAL 1.0](https://jsav-player-test-app.web.app) features the
following exercises: Insertion Sort, Heap Build, Dijkstra's algorithm,
Evaluating Postfix Expression, and search in a Binary Search Tree.
