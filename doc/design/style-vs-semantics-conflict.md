# Semantic color coding

## Description of requirements

No. Description

56  Save vector graphics in one standard format, e.g. SVG

57  The recording is compact, containing no redundant data.

72  There should be semantic color coding with e.g. structure-property   
    structure.

74  Nodes and edges should have a style [similar to CSS style].

## Conflicting requirements

Req. 56 and 57 imply together that semantics and vector graphics should be
kept separate.

To fulfill 72 and 74, JAAL subschema `style` was implemented, and it was
planned to be used in schemas `definitions`, `edge`, `node`, `graph`, and
`matrix`. This conflicts with the previous idea of keeping semantics and vector
graphics separate.


## Implementation problem

To fulfill 72 and 74, JSAV exercise recorder should produce semantic style
data. This raises two practical problems:
- What is the semantic style data that is relevant for a particular exercise?
- How to determine that style data?

There is a manually generated example of what is desired in
`test/valid/jaal-dijkstra-student.json`:
```
"styles": [
  {
    "name": "visited",
    "description": "Visited node, has yellow background.",
    "text-color": "#000000",
    "fill-color": "#fff050"
  },
  {
    "name": "unvisited",
    "description": "Unvisited node, has white background.",
    "text-color": "#000000",
    "fill-color": "#ffffff"
  },
  {
    "name": "unselected",
    "description": "Unselected edge, orange-grey",
    "text-color": "#000000",
    "fill-color": "#d59f0d"
  },
  {
    "name": "selected",
    "description": "An edge which is included to the single-source shortest path tree. Bright yellow.",
    "text-color": "#000000",
    "fill-color": "#ffe000"
  }
```

Johanna SÃ¤nger's investigation 27.5.2022:

submission/submission.js has the addStyle function which adds it to the
submission. Where I'm running into problems is the following:

Where to grab the data from. I see three ways of doing this, neither of which
seem ideal.

1. window.getComputedStyle() grabs all the current CSS properties. However, this
will require doing it at a state where there exist marked and unmarked edges +
nodes. This is not the case when initialising, and not guaranteed with
submitting.

2. Grabbing it from the CSS files themselves. This is not ideal either since
from what I can see the wanted information is split over 3 files
(dijkstraPE-research.css, JSAV.css, and odsaAV-min.css ). It would require
querying all three files and knowing which is the most specific of them.

3. hard-coding it from the exercise itself. Obviously not ideal since it
hardcodes it and thus requires manual updating if one of the style sheets is
updated.

Combiding the rules in the CSS files requires implementing the cascading
properties of CSS, which seems overkill. Moreover, the JavaScript code of
the exercises can set custom styles which breaks even this solution.

Ultimately, there seems to be no automatic, exercise-independent solution to
grab the semantic color coding.
* Every time the exercise calls methods `css()`, 'highlight()`,
`unhighlight`, `show`, `hide` of the JSAV objects, there is some visualization
semantics happening.
