# JAAL design documentation

## Design documents

The **software requirements** for JAAL are listed in
`design/requirements.ods`.
Some of the requirements are from Mariani's M.Sc. thesis, some from the
VISSOFT conference article; for these documents, see the
[../README.md](main README).

File `design/jsonschema-learning-notes.md` contains initial design notes for the
JAAL JSON schema: which JSON schema features to use, file organization.

File `design/data-structure-representations.md` describes how different exercise-based
data structures (lists, trees, graphs) should be represented in JAAL.

[JAAL Roadmap](design/roadmap.mp) is the long-term plan of features for JAAL
releases (versions).

## Structural documentation

File `jaal-schema-documentation.md` contains the detailed descriptions of
the JAAL JSON Schema subschemas and fields.

## Old JAAL versions

Older JAAL versions have some documentation in the subdirectory `versions`.
